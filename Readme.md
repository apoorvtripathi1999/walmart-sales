# **Walmart Sales Analysis and Forecasting using Google Cloud Platform and Machine Learning**

### **Project Description:**

This project leverages **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to efficiently store, process, and analyze Walmart sales data. Using **Google SQL**, I extract and transform the dataset to uncover key sales trends and patterns. Applying **data science techniques**  to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data, enabling the identification of critical insights such as sales trends, seasonality, and regional performance.
To enhance decision-making, I implement a **machine learning model** for **sales forecasting**, utilizing algorithms to predict future sales with high accuracy. The final insights and forecasts are then visualized using **Tableau**, providing an interactive and intuitive dashboard for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. I use a python library called **TabPy** to implement visualizations and macchine learning techniques in tableau while utilizing the features of python.
